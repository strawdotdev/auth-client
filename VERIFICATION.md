# Verification

## v0.6.0 — 2026-10-01

Better Auth's anonymous plugin is supported. A guest (`session.user.isAnonymous`) may use the
sign-in and sign-up workflows; signing in from a guest's session is synchronized as a link rather
than retired as an unrelated account, and its completion carries `guestUserId`. Organization,
invitation, session and account workflows, reauthentication, and (with guests) sign-out report
`accountRequired` to a guest; reads still run. The client-only `guests` capability signs a visitor
with no session in anonymously from `AuthDataProvider`, latches the first authentication for
`useGuestSession().isEstablished`, and returns a signed-out visitor to a fresh guest through the
same single guest sign-in. `getAuthErrorCode` is exported. Breaking: `WorkflowDisabledReason`
gains `accountRequired`, `WorkflowOperation` gains `signInAsGuest`, and anonymous users are no
longer treated as signed-in accounts.

- `pnpm check` and 98 controlled tests pass. The guest sign-in test fails on v0.5.1's
  synchronization (reported `obsolete`) when the session refetch settles before it renders.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled and Git-package installations passed.
- `pnpm test:e2e` against the example's local Convex backend and mailbox: all nine journeys passed
  in 1.5 minutes, including the new guest journey (guest, sign-up, verification, linked sign-in,
  sign-out to a fresh guest). The example backend now enables the anonymous plugin. A later
  type-only change (`isAnonymous` may be `undefined`) was not rerun in the browser.
- Not yet run in Gaia.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-09-29

A resource's first freshness signal no longer cancels and restarts a read that is already in
flight. The read finishes and its result is shown, then the resource refetches once in the
background, so first paint needs one round trip instead of two while no change between the read
and the signal can be missed. Later signals keep cancelling obsolete reads as before.

- `pnpm check` and 94 controlled tests pass, including a regression that fails on v0.5.0.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled and Git-package installations passed.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-09-29

Workflows now keep one loading contract: `isPending` means an owned action is running, and
workflows that own a read expose `isLoading` for its unsettled result. Previously the directory,
session and invitation workflows let action state overwrite read loading, so consumers saw neither
data nor pending while the first list loaded; settings, members, creation and profile used
`isPending` for their read instead. Resource reads now start once the Better Auth session is
known instead of waiting for Convex authentication, and the private cache is keyed to the user
session so readiness changes and token refreshes no longer discard in-flight reads.

- `pnpm check` and 93 controlled tests pass, including regressions for directory loading and
  session-only reads.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled and Git-package installations passed.
- Gaia's root check, unit tests and Organization web journeys passed against the local build.
  Breaking for consumers that read workflow `isPending` as read loading: use `isLoading`.

## v0.4.3 — 2026-09-16

Form validation remains serialized by the workflow action lock, but validation issues are now
represented only by form-owned field and form feedback. They retain the existing validation-error
outcome without creating operation feedback, recovery, or `onError` callbacks. Rejected writes and
later operation failures retain their existing feedback behavior.

- `pnpm verify`: 91 controlled tests plus library, backend, example, lint, and formatting checks.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled and Git-package installations passed.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: all eight isolated local browser journeys passed in 1 minute 24 seconds.
- Fallow reported no findings introduced by the release diff; existing findings remain inherited.
- Gaia's root check and affected deterministic suites passed against `v0.4.3-rc.1`. Focused web
  journeys passed for guest authentication, account overlays, compact and expanded invitation
  presentation, organization unavailability, and account switching. Stable `v0.4.3` contains the
  same implementation as the qualified candidate.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-09-15

Profile workflows now include active writes in their aggregate pending state, and direct profile
and sign-out actions enforce the same recovery restriction exposed by their action handles. Focused
controlled coverage proves modal-containment state and prevents successful primary writes from
being repeated while read-only recovery is pending. The release workflow passed controlled tests,
static checks, and compiled package and Git installation checks. Gaia's root check and 44 affected
deterministic tests passed against `v0.4.2-rc.1`; stable `v0.4.2` contains the same implementation.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-09-15

Workflow state now exposes aggregate `isPending` for presentation-level containment such as modal
dismissal. It is derived from the same action controller as individual action handles, keeping
ordinary consumers out of diagnostic pending-action metadata. The existing duplicate-submission
test now proves both aggregate and action-specific pending state. `pnpm check` and all 89 controlled
tests, package installation, Git installation, and all eight isolated browser journeys pass. Gaia's
affected static and deterministic checks passed against `v0.4.1-rc.1`; its six focused account and
workspace browser journeys passed in 1 minute 30 seconds. Stable `v0.4.1` contains that candidate
unchanged except for version and release documentation.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-09-15

Authentication and account workflows now share the same headless root/hook contract as the
organization and session workflows. Better Auth still owns credentials and reactive session state;
the adapter observes that session without caching a second copy. The application supplies a typed,
identity-checked reactive current-user projection for profile synchronization.

- `pnpm verify`: 89 controlled tests, type contracts, backend/example checks, lint, and formatting.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled imports, declarations, backend separation, and
  compilation-free `v0.4.0-rc.4` candidate installation passed.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: all eight isolated local browser journeys passed in 1 minute 18 seconds.
- Live email qualification passed against `uncommon-gopher-566`: delivered registration
  verification, password reset, and two-step email change completed in 37.8 seconds; the existing
  invitation verification/acceptance journey completed in 48.6 seconds.
- Gaia's installed-candidate root and affected deterministic checks passed. Its two-client
  organization synchronization/deletion journey, including unavailable-state recovery and
  application sign-out, passed in 1 minute 48 seconds.

Secret fields are cleared after submitted attempts. Successful writes retain only bounded internal
receipts for read or named cleanup recovery; retries do not resubmit credentials, consumed reset
tokens, or primary writes. Callback delivery remains owned by a mounted workflow even when the
official authentication provider remounts for an expected identity transition.

The RC.3 review split identity execution into bounded lifecycle, transaction, and failure
responsibilities and consolidated schema roots and email-request behavior. Fallow reports no new
dead code, complexity, duplication, or boundary findings across the complete v0.4 change.

RC.4 keeps sign-out available from an observed Better Auth session while Convex authentication is
temporarily unavailable. Sign-out still confirms session absence and retains the same recovery and
conflict guarantees.

Stable `v0.4.0` contains the qualified RC.4 implementation unchanged except for version and release
documentation.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-09-15

Ownership moved to `strawdotdev/auth-client`. Package metadata, installation guidance, and the
`@strawdev/resend-tui` v0.1.2 development dependency now resolve directly to canonical
`strawdotdev` repositories. Runtime behavior is unchanged. `pnpm verify` passed 77 controlled
tests; package, Git-installation, and all eight isolated browser journeys also passed. The
implementation qualified as `v0.3.1-rc.1` (source
`ebe5a102a33d880c9cb70ea515b7efef90b705a1`).

## Live email ownership — 2026-09-14

The isolated example keeps controlled mail local and selects Convex Resend explicitly for live
qualification. `@strawdev/resend-tui` v0.1.2 is pinned only as repository test tooling;
`@convex-dev/resend` 0.2.7 belongs only to the example backend, not the published Auth Client
runtime.

- `pnpm verify`: 77 controlled tests, backend/example types, lint, and formatting passed.
- `pnpm test:package`: the unchanged Auth Client runtime package installed and bundled in an
  isolated consumer.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: all eight local HTTP-mailbox browser journeys passed in 1 minute 24 seconds.
- `pnpm test:email`: the delivered wrong-account, verification, rejection, acceptance, membership,
  and canonical-completion journey passed against development deployment `uncommon-gopher-566` in
  45.5 seconds.

Auth Client owns the detailed authentication journey. Gaia retains only its template, route,
presentation, cleanup, and application-handoff checks; `resend-tui` owns component mailbox behavior.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-09-14

The implementation qualified as `v0.3.0-rc.1` (source `d12c8936f605dca96bdefb44f9434dfbfaaa72f1`). Stable changes only the version and documentation.

- `pnpm verify`: 77 controlled tests, backend integration, type contracts, lint, and formatting passed.
- `pnpm test:package` and `pnpm test:git`: compiled imports, declarations, backend separation, and compilation-free installation passed. The public RC tag was installed into Gaia through pnpm.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: eight isolated local Convex/Expo Web journeys passed. They cover root ownership, organization lifecycle, invitations, sessions, scope retirement, and read-only recovery.
- Gaia: root checks and affected deterministic suites passed, including session validation and deletion preparation. Live journeys passed for creation, dirty updates, section-preserving rename, failed writes, single-write recovery, coordinated deletion, account switching, invitation delivery/wrong-account/acceptance/rejection/leave, session revocation/freshness, and navigation away during pending work. Controlled HTTP member pagination/removal and compact/expanded packaged web reviews passed.

Gaia consumes roots above availability gates and standalone hooks for collection/account composition. Its controls no longer interpret workflow phases or assemble synchronization retries. Product policy, presentation, routing, cleanup, and unsupported account coordination remain outside this library.

## Retained limitations

- Member pagination fetches progressively larger HTTP prefixes; it is not cursor pagination.
- Session lists remain authoritative and bounded; the current session is separate.
- Native execution is unverified. Qualification uses Expo Web and non-production Convex targets only.
- Fallow retains the guarded action runner, two browser-covered example controls with estimated-coverage warnings, and two small invitation fragments. Their lifecycle/presentation differences do not justify another abstraction. Current findings are inherited; no suppressions or new findings were added.

## Reproduce

Run `pnpm verify`, `pnpm test:package`, and `pnpm test:git`. For browser qualification, use the isolated example setup in the README, then `pnpm test:e2e`. Publication uses the existing manually dispatched Release workflow; never move a published tag. Consumers install the compiled Git tag and do not build library source.
