 * Every account signed in on this device, from the multi-session plugin's cookies: the server half

 * tab) to act as its own account, `bearer()`. With the organization plugin, each account carries
 * its organizations and its role in each, so a switcher can show them without signing in as each.
 *
 * `GET /device-accounts/list` answers as `listDeviceSessions` does (one entry per user, the newest
 * sign-in last), each entry adding `organizations`.
 *
 * The device's session cookie keeps naming an account while one remains. When a context signs out
 * the device's current account while acting as another (multi-session moves the device on only
 * when the two are the same), the acting account becomes the device's. A session read for a
 * context's own account that finds it gone (signed out elsewhere) leaves the device's cookies as
 * they are: Better Auth would clear them, taking the device's own account with it. A guest (the
 * anonymous plugin) who signs in or up leaves the device's accounts, linked to the account.
