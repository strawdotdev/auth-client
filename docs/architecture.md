# Source organization

The package lives in `packages/auth-client`. Its name and public imports remain `@strawdev/auth-client`; moving source files does not add supported deep imports.

Domain folders supply context, so their implementation and type files do not repeat the domain name. Shared types contain only concepts used across workflows; organization and session types live with their implementations. The frontend entry point only exports supported symbols.

## Naming and ownership

- `useWorkflowAction` coordinates an operation; it is not another cache or authentication hook.
- `ActionExecution` describes guarded write/callback phases. It does not imply a database transaction or whole-endpoint atomicity.
- `useCommittedRef` retains the latest committed configuration for asynchronous work. Render-time options must not escape through an abandoned render.
- `useOrganizationRecovery` owns only the minimal successful-write receipt. Canonical organizations remain in the existing query cache.
- `useOrganizationResource` resolves explicit scope and observes organization/role reads. It does not select the session's active organization.
- `FormFieldIssue`, `FormValidationIssue`, and `FormFieldErrors` describe shared form feedback. Schema definitions preserve input/output inference across root and context consumers.
- Action handles, aggregate workflow `isPending`, and bound recovery feedback are the ordinary control contract. Workflow reads report `isLoading`, `isFetching`, and `queryError`; `isPending` never describes a read.
- Resource reads start as soon as the Better Auth session is known; Convex authentication gates only the freshness signals. Cached results belong to one user session and survive readiness changes and token refreshes. Diagnostic phases are for troubleshooting, not consumer sequencing. Recovery receipts remain internal to their domain.

Keep public names stable unless a consumer contract is intentionally revised. Internal filenames are not package exports. Do not import backend modules from frontend implementation, or React modules from backend helpers.

## Where changes belong

Add endpoint dependencies to `cache/resource-dependencies.ts`; lifecycle/invalidation changes belong in `cache/query-cache.ts`. Put a domain rule in its workflow unless multiple existing workflows need the same mechanism. Put platform lifecycle wiring, navigation, presentation, uploads, and application cleanup in the example or consumer.

Tests ending in `.types.ts` or `.types.tsx` are compile-time consumer contracts. Their names identify capabilities, endpoint inference, backend integration, Gaia compatibility, invitations, or organization/session workflows. Behavioral tests use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`. The package check compiles the same type contracts against an installed artifact.

The source tree is deliberately shallow. Avoid a generic utility layer or one-file-per-symbol decomposition. See [pagination](pagination.md) before replacing member reads with a direct Convex query.
